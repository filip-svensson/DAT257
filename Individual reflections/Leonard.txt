Individual reflection – Leonard Bagiu

General:
In the past, we’ve done projects but without a larger sense of structure. By using Scrum, the way of working throughout the project should make the structure a lot clearer than it has been in the past. I believe my contribution for this team could be working towards a clearer work structure and project management. 
As of such, I’d like for the group to work efficiently during sprints, but also adhering to a clear project structure with good communication during sprints. Furthermore, by adding team reflections between sprints I wish for the group to continuously improve the project structure and work ethic.

Week one:
By attending the workshop where four groups worked together during sprints to construct a city of lego, our team got a clearer idea of how to work with scrum. This was a valuable lesson, as no one within the team had any previous experience with working in a scrum structure. Furthermore, the group elected me as the scrum master, which posed the challenge of communicating with POs and other teams to evaluate how we could adapt our work towards a common goal. Hence, I believe this exercise gave much for the team for the rest of the course.

Week two:

We decided that the project would be easiest to work with in Javascript, Node more specifically.
One of our team members, Emil, has some experience working with Node in the past and is able to teach the rest of the team
how to work with it in a good way. I took initiative for the team to use Trello to be able to track other team members' progress.

Furthermore, we designed the first sprint, and where we would like to be after this sprint.

Learning goals:

I would like to learn how to work in Node.
I would like a good team structure, using frameworks such as Trello to achieve this.

Week three:

This week we had a meeting evaluating the strengths of every team member, also splitting into smaller teams for working more efficiently in sprints.
We also realized that none of us had experience with working with branching in git, which was delegated to me for structuring the project.
We split the project into a frontend part, a part for understanding the the air-quality API and the third for understanding the map-API.
I was placed in the frontend part, which I have some experience working with.
Furthermore, I took personal responsibility for teaching merging throughout the project.

Thus:
I want to improve my skills in git, project management and branching specifically.
I want to teach my team members how to work efficiently in HTML/CSS.
I want my team members to follow along with my personal improvements in Git, being able to track branches
and create their own working directories efficiently.
