Individual reflection – Leonard Bagiu

General:
In the past, we’ve done projects but without a larger sense of structure. By using Scrum, the way of working throughout the project should make the structure a lot clearer than it has been in the past. I believe my contribution for this team could be working towards a clearer work structure and project management. 
As of such, I’d like for the group to work efficiently during sprints, but also adhering to a clear project structure with good communication during sprints. Furthermore, by adding team reflections between sprints I wish for the group to continuously improve the project structure and work ethic.

Week one:
By attending the workshop where four groups worked together during sprints to construct a city of lego, our team got a clearer idea of how to work with scrum. This was a valuable lesson, as no one within the team had any previous experience with working in a scrum structure. Furthermore, the group elected me as the scrum master, which posed the challenge of communicating with POs and other teams to evaluate how we could adapt our work towards a common goal. Hence, I believe this exercise gave much for the team for the rest of the course.
