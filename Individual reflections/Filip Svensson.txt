=====Individual reflection week 1, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
-Since it is the first week I want to learn the Scrum method properly. Hopefully it will quick to adapt starting next week
when we get to start working on a project. Also, learning the A, B, A -> B reflective loop style.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-Everyone should contribute with the knowledge they have, so we can learn from each other. An encouraging attitude
towards the group project is always good.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-Again, since it's the first week we have not started working yet. Thereby no contributions done related to the use of Scrum.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-Other than helping with the social contract and repo setup. Project will begin next week.

=====Individual reflection week 2, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
-Got some better understanding over the method. We decided on our project idea and I will have the ambition to understand
all parts involved, however I will focus on my part and learn the rest if there is time.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-We can all try to really practice the Scrum method during this project development, I can help by making sure
I also do my best of following it.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-We've had a slow start. So we only really had meetings so far to discuss the project idea and pitch it. Hopefully we start the coding
process next week. That might help to fully utilize Scrum.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Helped come up with the idea for the project. I was feeling ill this week and stayed home when the group did
the project pitch, props to them!
