=====Individual reflection week 1, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
-Since it is the first week I want to learn the Scrum method properly. Hopefully it will quick to adapt starting next week
when we get to start working on a project. Also, learning the A, B, A -> B reflective loop style.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-Everyone should contribute with the knowledge they have, so we can learn from each other. An encouraging attitude
towards the group project is always good.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-Again, since it's the first week we have not started working yet. Thereby no contributions done related to the use of Scrum.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-Other than helping with the social contract and repo setup. Project will begin next week.

=====Individual reflection week 2, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
-Got some better understanding over the method. We decided on our project idea and I will have the ambition to understand
all parts involved, however I will focus on my part and learn the rest if there is time.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-We can all try to really practice the Scrum method during this project development, I can help by making sure
I also do my best of following it.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
-We've had a slow start. So we only really had meetings so far to discuss the project idea and pitch it. Hopefully we start the coding
process next week. That might help to fully utilize Scrum.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Helped come up with the idea for the project. I was feeling ill this week and stayed home when the group did
the project pitch, props to them!

=====Individual reflection week 3, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
We got the Trello working and project is ongoing. We chose to do it in HTML,CSS,Javascript and I've never programmed in these
languages before so the learning curve is a bit steep but manageble. I'd like to continue to learn the languages and progress.
I feel like I need to understand the diffrent stories in sprints better. This week me and Emil was responsible for
getting the air quality api to work, which we completed. However, I think it's more of a "developer story" rather than a user story.
Since we wrote the code that enables the people doing the display, they can use a function to get the measurements for a specific
station. Thus it feels like a developer feature.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
I can help the rest of the team members to learn how to use our chosen API now that I got the knowledge on how to do it.
So we all can get a better understanding of all parts of the project and not just the one we're assigned.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Me and Emil took the story of implementing the API. Our contribution this week was to deliver the promise made in the
first sprint, ahead of deadline.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Same as the question above. I did my part of the sprint in due time, and contributed in the way that we delivered what
was expected of us and before the deadline.

=====Individual reflection week 4, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel that I got a good grip around the basics of sprints now. Atleast regarding sprints and user stories. I now know
how to utilize the INVEST and got better at formulating the stories according to "As X I want Y since Z".
I noticed that I don't really have proper knowledge of KPIs and the different charts. Since our project group hasn't decided
on a PO yet we haven't really started discussing those topics.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
We took the advice to change the pairs working on the user stories for each sprint, with one of the persons working on a story
the previous sprint, stay in the same area so we can explain it to the one thats going to work on it this sprint.
I stayed in the air quality branch this week and Andy replaced Emil, so I helped Andy understand the coding we did and how it works.
This turned out to be a pretty effective way to spread the project knowledge between all team members.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We all created this sprints user stories together, and focused on the criteria. I helped check all the stories for the
INVEST criteria to see that they hold.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
As mention above, me and Andy had the developer story to convert the JavaScript to TypeScript. We delivered the story
today and fulfilled the checklist. I help Andy understand how the API implementation work so he get some understanding of that
part of the project.

=====Individual reflection week 5, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
We have a PO, and need to start working on the KPIs since we're approaching the end of this course. I have yet to
learn how to practice the different aspects of that part of Scrum. So for week six I hope we get a lot done in that area.
When it comes to learning related to the project I'm starting to get satisfied. I can't expect to master html, css and
typescript in a course like this. But I'm getting around the basics and got a general understanding on how they work. I'd
like to put the focus on Scrum the following two weeks that are left.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As previous weeks continue to share the knowledge gained from different stories made during the sprints. And also
encourage to fully practice Scrum 'by the book', even if this course maybe is more of a preview. It feels hard to
apply it correctly in a university course during eight weeks, but make the most out of it.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Doing stories, helping with the MVP and also help to separate the sprint reviews from the sprint retrospective. Up until now
we've had a bit of a misconception and thought they were basically the same thing. During the previous weeks we kind of
did a merging of those two and the team reflection, unaware that they are separate things.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Me and Ernst had the user story to expand the measurement points provided on the map. To do this we needed another API to be
integrated. We found that 'OpenAQ' actually combined a lot of public air quality APIs around the world into one, including
the one we first had from Gothenburg City. We low balled the story to try to just understand the API and possibly integrate it.
However, we managed to fully integrate it. This will probably set a new direction during the next sprint planning on Tuesday, since
we now have the opportunity to expand our product to include all of Sweden, even the whole world if deemed suiting. So the agile part
of agile software development really expressed itself during this sprint for me.

=====Individual reflection week 6, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
We had a meeting with our PO this week. We got feedback, and leveled on the MVP definition for this product. We
also took some notes and made her grade some diffrent aspects regarding design, UX and so on in a scale 1-10. The questions
will be asked again during next PO meeting and we can define the KPIs as the progress in changes of her gradings. However, I still feel a bit
loose on the KPI part and would like to understand them better.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As stated in previous weeks, continue to share the knowledge gained from different stories made during the sprints. And keep the
structure of Scrum until the end of the course.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
We had the PO meeting, and I helped make some point for our PO to grade which we can later use to create Kpis. Besides that
it has been the same as the previous week.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
This week me and Andy tried to make a new menu, based on input from our PO. We got the major part of it done but struggle
with the communication between our html and typescript files. So we will seek some help from the more experienced persons in
our group and hopefully learn something new.
