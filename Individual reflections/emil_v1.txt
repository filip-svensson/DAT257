This week we played around with lego and faced the challenges of planning our work together as well as estimating
the required time to complete different tasks.

What we should focus on learning as a team is finding a common understanding of the poker cards, for example 100
could mean 100% of the project, or 100 hours or some other arbitrary metric which all the team members understand
and agrees on.

In the current state of the project, it is hard to say what I will be able to learn other team members or answer
in detail what I will contribute.
