Week 1
This week we played around with lego and faced the challenges of planning our work together as well as estimating
the required time to complete different tasks.

What we should focus on learning as a team is finding a common understanding of the poker cards, for example 100
could mean 100% of the project, or 100 hours or some other arbitrary metric which all the team members understand
and agrees on.

In the current state of the project, it is hard to say what I will be able to learn other team members or answer
in detail what I will contribute.

Week 3
what do I want to learn or understand better?
    I'd like to understand the APIs of this project better and its proper usages.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    Since I've done a bit of javascript and built my own API integrated with a javascript web page
    I have some background information that's valuable for most aspects of this project. To share this information
    I think it's good to do all the work in small teams and never completely individually if it's not absolutely
    necessary.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    So far the biggest contribution I've made to scrum is showing up at meetings and trying to respect
    the process and be helpful in discussions about how to split up the work.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Both writing code and helping other write code.
