-----------------------------------------------Week 1--------------------------------------------------------------
This week we played around with lego and faced the challenges of planning our work together as well as estimating
the required time to complete different tasks.

What we should focus on learning as a team is finding a common understanding of the poker cards, for example 100
could mean 100% of the project, or 100 hours or some other arbitrary metric which all the team members understand
and agrees on.

In the current state of the project, it is hard to say what I will be able to learn other team members or answer
in detail what I will contribute.

-----------------------------------------------Week 3--------------------------------------------------------------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
    I'd like to understand the APIs of this project better and its proper usages.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    Since I've done a bit of javascript and built my own API integrated with a javascript web page
    I have some background information that's valuable for most aspects of this project. To share this information
    I think it's good to do all the work in small teams and never completely individually if it's not absolutely
    necessary.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    So far the biggest contribution I've made to scrum is showing up at meetings and trying to respect
    the process and be helpful in discussions about how to split up the work.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Both writing code and helping other write code.

------------------------------------------------Week 4--------------------------------------------------------------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
    This week I wanted to understand how to implement a more beautiful frontend while still maintaining the
    functionality of the map. Also working with htlm and css more or less vanilla in comparison to other projects
    I´ve worked on.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    This week I didn´t provide much help to other team member since I was doing a task solo. We did however as a team
    improve on the meeting structure, and I hope my input was valuable and contributed to the team effort.
    I might on occasion have chipped in some helpful advice if happening to be in the same room while some other team
    member was working on their part but this happens on a weekly basis and is not unique for this sprint nor an
    explicit goal.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    I´ve tried to help with the meeting agendas and taking as many notes as possible in relevant situations, for example
    sprint meetings and supervisions. The team did an effort together to merge the project and I were an active part in
    it.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Both writing code and helping other write code. Also having a short meeting with the stakeholder and retrieving
    some valuable information and suggestions for improvement.

------------------------------------------------Week 5--------------------------------------------------------------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
    This week I continued to work on the frontend and worked on implementing a skeleton for the search functionality
    and basic buttons necessary for it. I wanted to understand html and css better and I feel like the languages are
    a bottomless pit in terms of learning and implementation.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    This week we worked as a team on the frontend development and bringing in a team member who had not yet touched it
    was a great opportunity to teach and help him understand the basics of html/css. We went through the entire project
    so far and played around a bit with the code to easier demonstrate the different aspects of html/css, in the process
    also discovering some things I myself did not understand.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    Continuing to take notes in relevant situations and showing up to meetings. This week I feel like we've reached a
    better understanding of how to work together. We've also started to have meetings with our stakeholder and found
    a better understanding of where to take the project by involving KPIs as well. KPIs are something however that I
    individually and we as a team need to understand better.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Both writing code and helping other write code. Trying to focus on the KPIs when writing user stories.

------------------------------------------------Week 6--------------------------------------------------------------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
    This week I didn't focus too much on technical learning and instead on reaching an acceptable product in accordance
    with our stakeholder. However I feel like reaching an agreement on product acceptability is something to learn from.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    Since we worked on tuning minor aspects of the project this week, to learn others something new was pretty difficult.
    I tried to be available answering questions regarding the parts of the project I was more comfortable.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    Continuing to take notes in relevant situations and showing up to meetings. The meetings have really taken a proper
    form now and feel quite efficient. Trying to keep the user stories at a reasonable level.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Mostly trying to clean up code and doing text edits, adding some information about the parameters of the points on
    the map.

------------------------------------------------Week 7--------------------------------------------------------------
what do I want to learn or understand better?
   The final week of working on the project we started to conclude what we have learned about agile and reflecting on
   what we would have done differently if we had started the project over again. Most of it is about the agile aspects
   such as meeting structure, how to write user stories and involving stakeholder/PO more closely.
how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
    Discussing what I personally liked and didn't like about our way of working trying to find different angels of what
    we have done and achieved during this project.
what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
    Continuing to take notes in relevant situations and showing up to meetings. This week the workload was mostly about
    finalizing the product, merging code and getting it ready for hand in/presentation.
what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
    Finishing up the final user stories and helping others with theirs as well. Making sure the stakeholder is satisfied.
