I would want to understand how a coding team work
and gain experience for future work. As of now I've never worked in such a team.

I hope to be able to contribute with own strengths
as I've worked a lot in groups and can help in meetings.

I think I can help get this done since im very keen to learn
and find out what needs to be done even though I'm quite a rookie in coding.
