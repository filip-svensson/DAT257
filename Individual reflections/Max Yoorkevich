Individual reflection - Max Yoorkevich

First week:

Before, I've worked on a project as a team. But due to lacking skills and experience the processes were not optimal. For
example when using git where everything was made on a master branch, this made pushing and pulling very clunky.
I'd like to learn more about working as a team where each member has a responsibility to perform and work well together
efficiently. In order for us to do so, communication, helping each other and a will to improve will most likely get
us there.

I'm used to my school partners asking for help, and me getting it when needed. My ideal when it comes to help overall
would be that there are no filters between members (referring to feeling inferior when asking for help) for things to
go as smoothly as possible. At the same time, helping too much is a problem in and of itself since it can hinder
personal development. Being clear with this, and stopping each other if we go too far in helping is in my opinion the
best way.

Since I've not worked in a Scrum manner before, it's very hard for me to say exactly what my contribution will be.
Being a valued member and voicing my ideas will hopefully be what I'm capable of at the end of this course.
In order to do so, I'll also let my project partners to show these characteristics.

Finishing tasks on time, asking for help, helping, communicating and taking each member into consideration has always
ideas that I value and strive for. In this course, I hope to elaborate these ideas and at the same time give room for
my partners to do the same. Mainly, I hope to improve my programming skills in regards to working in a Scrum fashion.
