Week 1

I would want to understand how a coding team work
and gain experience for future work. As of now I've never worked in such a team.

I hope to be able to contribute with own strengths
as I've worked a lot in groups and can help in meetings.

I think I can help get this done since im very keen to learn
and find out what needs to be done even though I'm quite a rookie in coding.

Week 2

I want to understand how HTML-code is built and how webpages work in depth.
Since we have a few that knows from previous work how to build a webpage, I'll be the one learning
a lot, but I'll do my best trying to find things that even the experienced have a hard time finding.

In Scrum I can help with a lot of the administrative work, getting the ones who know the work to
give out a proper amount of work. My contribution is still to be planned this week.

Week 3

I more precisely want to learn how to get up buttons, and how to properly position elements in the
properties. I can help my team by learning, looking up youtube videos and tutorials.
Scrum this week is going to be comprised of thinking up user stories and dividing into smaller more
effective groups.

My contribution on deliveries is going to be mostly design of the webpage.
