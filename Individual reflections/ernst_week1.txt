I do not have much experience in working as a team in creating a software and it is
something I would like to learn more about and develop that skill. In order to do that I will
work with scrum in this course to the best of my abilities together with my team.

I will help as much as I can by contributing with my own knowledge and take part of the
knowledge from the others in the team.

To be active in our meetings and making sure I complete the tasks assigned to me.

I will make sure to keep up with our internal deadlines and ask for help if needed
in order for everything to be according to schedule.
