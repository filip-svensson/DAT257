Week 1

I do not have much experience in working as a team in creating a software and it is
something I would like to learn more about and develop that skill. In order to do that I will
work with scrum in this course to the best of my abilities together with my team.

I will help as much as I can by contributing with my own knowledge and take part of the
knowledge from the others in the team.

To be active in our meetings and making sure I complete the tasks assigned to me.

I will make sure to keep up with our internal deadlines and ask for help if needed
in order for everything to be according to schedule.

Week 2

In week two not many things changed and my scope was basically the same as what is written in
week 1
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Week 3

What I would like to learn better is to be able to understand and use the API
that we are using for our map. As well as being able to work and contribute to a project
when there are many smaller teams within the team.

I will help to the best of my abilities by learning and using the map API and thus being able to use
it for our specific needs. Then I will share my knowledge with the rest of the team and
take part of the knowledge they have gained.

I will keep being active in our Sprint meetings and making sure our deadlines are being held
and that we are not passing anything of to the stakeholder that doesn't fill the requirements
for definition of done.

I will continue to be active, ask for help if I need it, provide help if it is required.

Week 4

This week I have started becoming more comfortable in the Scrum way of doing things and
working in the sprints. In the coming sprint I will work more on the frontend side of things
in order to learn about that area, because I have mostly been working with the backend up until
now

Just like the previous weeks I will contribute with the knowledge I have. When it comes to frontend
my team partner definitely has more experience than me so I will try to learn as much as possible
this week in order to share the work with the team during our next sprint review. And if
in order to achieve some goals within the User story we need to add something in the
backend I will provide my knowledge.

We all have an open dialog when it comes to setting up the user stories and I contribute
with both ideas and making sure INVEST criteria are met.

Me and Leo, who I am working with this week we will try to have achieved our user story on time
with time to spare to the next team meeting. If we notice the user story is too big we may
have to inform the rest of the team in order to set up the next weeks sprints.

Week 5

*What do I want to learn or understand better?

Since lasts week sprint didn't really go as planned (the workload would've been massive and
would have to restart the project in another framework) and was put on hold.
this week I will be working with implementing another API that possibly could replace the one
we have.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I can be able to teach the rest of the team about the functionality of the new API
once it has been implemented. The goal is to make sure that points can be added dynamically
to the map. If this succeeds it will make coming sprints much easier because of the new API
with more data than the last one.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Set up user stories with the others in the team and making sure they are following invest criteria.
Also setting up meeting with the stakeholder in terms of discussing the MVP and KPIs

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

To make sure that we have it done in time and that it doesn't interfere with other important
files in the code. In case of it actually interfering we will discuss with the team members
whose file we may have altered in and making sure everyone is on the same page.

Week 6

*What do I want to learn or understand better?

This week I will be going back to frontend, something I haven't been working with super
much in this project and what I want to learn is how to put some basic information about our program
on the frontpage of the website. It will be fun to mix things up a little since last week
me and Filip did a lot of backend work.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Since so far I am working alone on a smaller user story I will be of as much help as I can
in case some of my other team members need help with their user story.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

To attend all the sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives and team meetings where we discuss
upcoming sprint and dividing up user stories that fits the INVEST criteria.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

To be on time with my contribution and making sure that it is not something half assed.
Also to be of any necessary assistance if any other members of the team should require it.
