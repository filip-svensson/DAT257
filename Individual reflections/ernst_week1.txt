I do not have much experience in working as a team in creating a software and it is
something I would like to learn more about and develop that skill. In order to do that I will
work with scrum in this course to the best of my abilities together with my team.

I will help as much as I can by contributing with my own knowledge and take part of the
knowledge from the others in the team.

To be active in our meetings and making sure I complete the tasks assigned to me.

I will make sure to keep up with our internal deadlines and ask for help if needed
in order for everything to be according to schedule.

Week 3

What I would like to learn better is to be able to understand and use the API
that we are using for our map. As well as being able to work and contribute to a project
when there are many smaller teams within the team.

I will help to the best of my abilities by learning and using the map API and thus being able to use
it for our specific needs. Then I will share my knowledge with the rest of the team and
take part of the knowledge they have gained.

I will keep being active in our Sprint meetings and making sure our deadlines are being held
and that we are not passing anything of to the stakeholder that doesn't fill the requirements
for definition of done.

I will continue to be active, ask for help if I need it, provide help if it is required.
