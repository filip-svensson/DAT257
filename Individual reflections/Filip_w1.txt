=====Individual reflection week 1, Filip=====
*What do I want to learn or understand better?
-Since it is the first week I want to learn the Scrum method properly. Hopefully it will quick to adapt starting next week
when we get to start working on a project.

*How can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
-Everyone should contribute with the knowledge they have, so we can learn from each other. An encouraging attitude
towards the group project is always good.

-Again, since it's the first week we have not started working yet. Thereby no contributions done related to the use of Scrum.

*What is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
-Other than helping with the social contract and repo setup. Project will begin next week.
