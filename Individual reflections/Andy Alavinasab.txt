changed much.

This week I've learned more about typeScript while working on converting from javascript to typescript. I've

As the goal of this week was for me to learn more of typescript in order to be able to teach it next week I wont really
be able to help others this week unless absolutely necessary. Next week though I will be able to
share the things I learn now.
