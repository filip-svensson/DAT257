First Week

* what do I want to learn or understand better?
- In order to learn or understand better I need to listen to constructive critisism from groupmembers and also
actively engage myself in others code to get an understanding of the project as a whole.

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- I can share knowledge I know that others might not and also always try to help the group in any manner possible.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- I will complete my share of the work and also try to help the others where I can.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- Same as above.

Second week

This week, nothing has happened in terms of coding. Mostly we have had a few meetings about our goals in this
project as well as how to accomplish them, what APIs to use and so on. As such, my answers from last week haven't
changed much.

Third week

* what do I want to learn or understand better?
- This week I would like to learn both CSS and HTML in order to start
with the website next week. I also want to understand a bit of JavaScript to better be able to cooperate with the team.

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
- Share the things I learn and in turn they will do the same and we will all learn more.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
- My contribution is doing my sprints as well as helping the
others in the group when and if they need it. I have a responsibility to share my visions and goals each meeting
to further the idea as a whole.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
- Mostly doing my work in the epics that are related to my part of the project for this week which is the webpage.

Fourth week

* what do I want to learn or understand better?
This week I've learned more about typeScript while working on converting from javascript to typescript. I've
also learned more typescript from the writing of the popup.

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
As the goal of this week was for me to learn more of typescript in order to be able to teach it next week I wont really
be able to help others this week unless absolutely necessary. Next week though I will be able to
share the things I learn now.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contribution will be doing the user stories I have chosen for this week with the two teams I am in.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
To help in the teams I am in as well as possible and also the same as above.

Fifth week

* what do I want to learn or understand better?
I feel now that I understand the general structure of scrum and how to work in a team using this method. I've begun
learning multiple new languages through the course. I would like to continue learning web development as I feel this
is an important for a developer to know. To this end I've chosen one of the larger user stories this week which envelops
all three languages used in our program this week.

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Just like previous weeks I will help where I can especially if someone has any questions around the areas of the
program I feel most confident in. I can also share little tidbits of information that I discover through coding that
might help the others write more efficiently.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
Like before, I will complete the user stories I choose as well as contributing as much as possible during meetings
where we decide what direction to take the project now that MVP is achieved. Completion of user stories is especially
important this week as we have quite a lot and most only have one person assigned to them.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
I will, like above do the user stories I am assigned and contribute as I can during meetings but also to learn more about
git in order to make sure that merging of the branches goes well this week especially as more branches will most likely
be created due to the increase in user stories and the more individual work this week.

Sixth week

* what do I want to learn or understand better?
Just like last week I would like to understand all aspects of the project better and such have chosen two user stories
that I feel encompass this. By coding more in html, css and ts I want to improve as a developer and through this also
be better at scrum by the end of the week.

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
Just like previous weeks I can teach them new things I learn as well as always strive to make the project the best
it can be. I also want us to not slack off just because it is the last week.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
My contributions will be the user stories I have chosen as well as my contributions during meetings discussing the
final stages of the project and how we would like to wrap the whole thing up.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
Just like above to complete my user stories and also with making sure that merging of all branches goes smoothly. I
will try to make sure that everybody has something to do and help where it is needed.

Seventh week

* what do I want to learn or understand better?
As the project is wrapping up I am beginning to conclude the things I have learned in the course which I would
summarise to a better understanding of how a project structure should look. In that I include better meetings, both
what is needed to streamline a meeting as well as the things to be brought up during one. I also include the writing of
user stories, both for the product owner and for the developer in order to define what needs to be done during a
sprint.

* how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?
In order to help others in the group I feel that it is important to write structured code that is easy to understand,
not only for the one who wrote it but for others too. A big part of a sprint might otherwise be wasted just to understand
what has been done previously. But of course offering help, but also accepting it, is helpful to be more efficient.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?
The individual should always strive to contribute towards planning of sprints and user stories as all people in the
team have different strengths and different sources of input will lead to a better planned project. I also believe that
the individual should not accept too much responsibility as to not overwork themselves and risk delaying deliveries.

* what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?
My contribution will be finishing my own user stories and helping others finish theirs as much as I can. To make sure
the merged branches and master branch works well is also a responsibility everyone shares. To this end, not interfering
with others code is helpful to not get merge conflicts and complicate things.
